  "It was one stormy night as Mina lay on the beach. She was a solo navigator sailor that was in a race around the world in her boat which was nowhere to be seen. She lay on the beach as they day went by. Suddenly, she woke up. “I am alive” she whispered to herself. A dark shadow glanced upon her. Then it disappeared. She felt like she was being watched. Was she on a deserted island or an inhabited land?I looked around slowly. I found a fish in a nearby rock pool that must have been carried through the hard night. I caught it and saved it for later. Suddenly I hear this strange noise and I am paralysed for 10 seconds. All was black! I could not see anything. Then it all stopped. I felt like I was dying. I needed to get some food into me before I feel crazy.I found a good place to make a fire. I needed a flammable resource and some wood to cook the fish. I found and old shipwreck and took some wood from that. I also found some lichen on a tree. I used them to make a fire. I ate the fish and it was lovely. I felt much better so I decided to explore the rest of the island.I walked up a path which would take me to the plateau. I suddenly realised that there was a strange mechanism on the side of the cliff. It was old and rusty. I was not quite sure what it was used for so I thought that this island was inhabited after all…I walked onto the plateau. It was so quiet and peaceful. There was some smoke coming from over the bush. Could it be an inhabited building? I walked over there. No! It was just steam coming from the hot spring. I could use it to cook something. I turn around. There is a snake hissing at me. I slowly picked up a forked branch and pinned it to the ground. I walked over to a broken stair case. I had to fix it somehow.I hear a cry from an abandoned cottage. I run over there. There is an injured monkey. I decide to give it a name. I called him Jep. I cleaned his wound and gave him some grapes from a grape vine. We found an old abandoned wind mill. The sails had been torn off and we needed to repair it. I took a bit of my shirt off and replaced the old sales. Eventually we got the windmill working. There were no trees around the windmill area and there were hardly any trees around the plateau so anyone could see the mill spin from miles away. Suddenly I thought that if I could keep it spinning for ages then someone might recognise it. I heard a noise. It was the rescue team! They had found me. They took me home.",
  "This tale is from Argentina and tells the story of a young girl, the friendship she develops with a wild puma, and how kindness is repaid.Once there was a girl named Callista. Her father was a soldier, and after the country in which she was born, Spain, invaded South America, she moved to Argentina with her family.The people who lived in Argentina were angry the Spanish had taken over their land, so they surrounded the camp in which the Spanish families were living, hoping to make them leave.Callista was told not to leave the camp, but she was hungry. So, one day, she snuck out to find food.As she explored the jungle, she came across a cave where a mother puma had just given birth. Callista helped the mother puma clean the cubs and found food for her to eat.One day the native people found Callista, and she was scared. However, they did not harm her and instead took her back to their village, gave her food, and looked after her. Callista felt loved and at home and lived there a long while.Then, the Spanish soldiers attacked the village, found Callista, and took her back to the camp. Her father was very angry with her and sent soldiers to tie her to a tree in the jungle as punishment. She was there for days.The village people were scared she might die, but they were also scared of the Spanish soldiers. After three days, they went to try to rescue Callista but feared she would be dead. However, when they got to the trees, Callista was fine.The puma Callista cared for had come back to look after her.The villagers untied Callista and took her home with them, where she lived a long and happy life.",
  "There was once an emperor who didnot care about ruling his land. Instead, all he cared about was living in his palace, having the finest food and drink, owning the most expensive things, and most of all, wearing the most beautiful clothes.One day some crooks came to the land. They told the emperor they had the finest cloth in the world, but it was magical. Only the smartest, most brilliant, most influential people could see it, and anyone who was not brilliant, intelligent, or important could see nothing.When the emperor was shown the cloth, he could see nothing at all, and he was scared.“If people find out I am not clever, or smart, or important, they will choose another emperor,” he thought. “Then, I will not be the most important person in the land, and the finest things will not surround me.”So the emperor told the crooks that yes, it was the finest cloth he had ever seen and asked them to make an outfit for his grand parade.On the day of the parade, everyone in the kingdom came to see the emperor. They had all heard about the magical cloth and wanted to see it for themselves.The giant parade began, and the emperor walked down the great National Mall. Nobody could see the magical clothes, but everyone was too afraid to speak up.A child then pointed at the emperor and asked, “Why is not he wearing any clothes?”This made other people brave enough to speak up, and soon, almost the entire kingdom was talking about the silly emperor. He was so worried about beautiful clothes, expensive things, and what people thought, he walked down the street naked rather than telling the truth.",
  "You Need A Lion Whisker This fairy tale from Ethiopia tells the story of a woman who learns there are no shortcuts and that patience, perseverance, and hard work are essentialLeeya married a man who already had a son. She tried to be friends with the boy, but nothing she did worked. So Leeya went to see the medicine man in the mountains.“Please help me,” Leeya said. “I want the boy to be happy and to be friends with him. I have tried for an entire week, but nothing works.”“I can help, but first, I need you to pluck a whisker from a living lion and bring it to me,” he said.Leeya was afraid, but she wanted to be friends, so she went to where the lions lived.Every day for a month, Leeya would put out a bowl of meat and watch from behind a rock when the lion came to feed.The next month she did the same thing but knelt up, so her head was showing. The next month she stood taller so the lion could see her from the waist up, and the following month she stood beside the rock.For the next six months, she inched closer to the lion. In the tenth month, she stood next to him while he ate. In the eleventh, she held the bowl, and in the twelfth month, she would place her hand on the lion face.Finally, she was brave enough to pluck a whisker from the lion, and she took it to the medicine man. The medicine man accepted the whisker from her and threw it into the fire.“Why did you do that?” asked Leeya. “I worked hard for a full year to get that whisker.”“You worked hard,” said the medicine man. “You were patient, gave the lion what it needed, and gained its trust. Is it any harder to do the same for a young boy who misses his mother?”Then Leeya understood. There were no shortcuts, but patience, love, understanding, and perseverance would get her where she wanted to be",
  "Swapping Places This ancient tale is as relevant today as it was when it was first told. Everybody's job may seem easy until you have to do it yourself.Long ago, there was a family. The man went out every day to work on the farm, and the woman stayed in the house, working to look after the children and the home.One day the farmer came home and complained the house was a mess, the baby was crying, there was no butter, no bread, and his dinner was not ready.“What do you do all day?” he asked his wife angrily. “I could do a better job in one day than you do all week.”“Okay, then,” said his wife, “Tomorrow I will work on the farm, and you will look after the home.”And that is what they did.The woman went out early to work in the field, and the man began his day by feeding the chickens and putting milk in the churn to make butter.But the baby started crying, so he went to pick him up. While the man was shushing the baby, their toddler ran into the kitchen, knocked over the churn, and milk spilled everywhere.The man started to clean up the mess but realized he hadn't given the children their breakfast. He began to make breakfast, but he'd forgotten to close the door when he fed the chickens, and now they were in the house, leaving feathers and poop everywhere.And so it went on, all day. Every time he tried to do something, the farmer found other things went wrong.When the woman returned from the fields, she found the house covered in feathers and chicken poop. The children were hungry and dirty and had run through the milk leaving a sticky, smelly trail. She found her husband sitting on the bed with a crying baby.“I am sorry, dear wife,” he said, “I cannot believe all of the things you have to juggle while you work hard at home every day. I will never complain again.”And he didn't. Not only that, on the days he came home to no food, he would cook supper for the family, help with the children, and churn the butter for the next day.",
  "Four pairs of children's shoes were lined up on our kitchen countertop, ready for a good shine before church in the morning. It was near midnight on ChristmasEve 1968, and everyone else in the house was asleep.I had the TV on low in the living room. The astronauts manning the Apollo 8 spacecraft kept me company, the footage from the mission a comforting hum in the background. As I worked the polish into my daughter's little saddle shoe, my mind kept wandering to her upcoming appointment at New York Presbyterian Hospital.Lauren was four years old. Outwardly, nothing was wrong with her—she was a happy, healthy little girl. But she hardly said a word, even though her hearing tests appeared normal. Two years of seeking help locally failed to offer any answers. Doctors and therapists seemed to chalk her silence up to her being the youngest of four, with the older kids doing the talking for her.Mother's intuition told me it was more than that. I'd finally gotten an appointment with a specialist at New York Presbyterian, an audiologist who ranked high in her field. I could hardly wait for our appointment a week into the new year.And if we get a diagnosis, then what?I thought, polishing around the toe of Lauren's shoe. If it wasn't Lauren's hearing, was it something worse?Thoughts like that aren't helping anyone, I told myself.Just keep polishing.To do that, I needed more shoe polish. That's when I heard… church bells.The TV broadcast had cut to the Midnight Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. As a practicing Catholic, I'd been taught to kneel and tap my chest for the coming of Jesus Christ.No one's here to see me,I thought, not particularly wanting to stop my work. But tradition won out. I put down the polish, barely dropped to one knee, quickly tapped my chest and got ready to pop back up.Instead, I froze. The tap to my chest seemed to reverberate. I felt a tap in return—a deep, barely perceptible feather's touch, right where I imagined my soul to be. An all-powerful, almighty wave of love overtook me. It flooded the house like a tsunami. Love flowed in from the window, over the counter, rose from the floor and rained down from the ceiling.I shut my eyes, both knees on the linoleum floor now, my head bowed. I didn't dare move as the love swept through the house, surrounding me—filling me. I felt gloriously perfect in God's eyes, even with all my glaring, human faults.The divine love receded as quickly as it had come. I didn't want it to leave. I wanted to go with it! But it was gone, and I was left kneeling in the kitchen, feeling oddly empty. Whatever had just happened was a miracle.But why me?I thought, looking around in a daze.Lauren.My mind jumped to Lauren. Something must be seriously wrong. And God was bracing me to face it.A week after New Year's, Lauren and I went to her appointment. The audiologist diagnosed Lauren in minutes. “I've been doing this for 20 years,” she said. “Your daughter's severely hard of hearing. I can tell by talking to her.” Tests confirmed the doctor was correct, and she arranged follow-up treatment, including hearing aids, to begin the very next week at Lenox Hill Speech and Hearing Center.“With words come ideas,” the lanky doctor at Lenox Hill told us when we got there. “That means this is an emergency at your daughter's age. If she doesn't learn to speak now, her abilities will be damaged forever.” Lauren needed therapy four days a week, with homework every night, including weekends.Lauren's progress was impressive, and she was never truly discouraged. As she got older, she faced many challenges in public schools geared toward hearing children. Whenever I worried whether she could meet those challenges, I'd think of that tidal wave of love I'd felt, God's love. Lauren didn't know about my Christmas Eve blessing. I wasn't sure she'd understand if I told her. And I didn't want her to think she'd caused me such pain that I'd needed divine intervention. But the memory of it sustained me all through her growing-up years.It wasn't until Lauren was in her thirties—married, with children of her own—that I finally decided to tell her about it. There was nothing special about the day I made the decision. It just seemed like it was time I shared my experience.I went over to her house one Saturday afternoon in August. As we leaned against her kitchen countertop, I carefully described what I'd felt that Christmas Eve night. She didn't stop me once to ask a question. Did she not believe me?“I remember,” Lauren said when I finished. “I watched the whole thing.”But she'd been in bed upstairs…“I couldn't sleep,” she said, “so I crept downstairs. You were in the kitchen. The shoes were all lined up on the countertop. I peeked in and saw you on your knees. The bells were ringing. An angelic light filled the house. I knew God was with us.”“But you were so young. How did you know what you were seeing?”Lauren looked at me with perfect confidence. “I just did.”Finally I knew the truth. God had come to both of us that Christmas Eve night. And he and his angels had been watching over us ever since.",
  "One day two children were playing in a stream. When they got out, they were chilly, but the girl saw a soft, mossy area in the sun.“Let's go and sit there,” she said, “It will be warm in the sun.”The children laid on the moss and soon fell asleep. As the day went on, the rock inched upwards to keep them close to the sun and warm. The children were so comfortable they stayed asleep.At dinner time, the children's family searched everywhere but could not find them.Then coyote sniffed the ground, followed the childrens trail, and said, “They must be on top of this new rock.”Antelope was the best jumper, and the family asked him to get the children, but he could only reach a short way up the rock.Grizzly bear was the best climber, so they asked her to get the children, but she could only reach a little higher than antelope.All of the animals tried — jackrabbit, raccoon, even mountain lion, but none could reach the children.“Let me try,” said the inchworm, and all of the animals laughed.“You are too small,” they said. “How could you possibly do what we couldn't?”But the children's family asked him to try.Slowly, slowly, the inchworm passed the points the other animals had reached. Finally, he got to the top and woke the children by crawling on their faces and led them down the mountain.That day, the Miwok named the rock Tutokanula in honor of the inchworm, the tiny creature who achieved great things",
  "The Reward is a cautionary tale from India and warns against the dangers of being greedy.There once was an emperor named Akbar. He went hunting in the woods, but when it started to get dark, he became lost. A young boy, Mahesh, heard the emperor calling for help, went into the jungle, and led him back to the palace.As a reward, the emperor took a ring from his finger and gave it to Mahesh.“Bring this ring back to the palace in the morning, show it to the guards, and tell them to let you in,” said the emperor, “Then I can reward you for your kindness.”The next day Mahesh came back to the palace, showed the ring to the guard, and asked to see the emperor. However, the guard was a greedy man and told Mahesh, “I will only let you in if you give me half of your reward.”Mahesh agreed and went to see the emperor.“I would like 50 lashes as my reward,” said Mahesh.The emperor tried to talk him out of it, but Maresh insisted. After the 25th lash, Mahesh stopped the emperor and explained about the guard.The emperor was very angry with the guard. He went out and gave the guard the remaining 25 lashes and fired him on the spot.Then the emperor asked Maresh again what he would like as a reward.“I promised the guard half of everything,” Maresh said, “So I do not want any further reward.”So, instead, the emperor gave Mahesh's family a new home and all they needed to enjoy a happy life."
